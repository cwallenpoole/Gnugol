Several high end security models have been investigated for gnugol,
to add encryption and strong authentication. The most promising
appears to be DTLS - datagram TLS - which is part of openssl. 

The disadvantages of this are several round trips required for setup,
a large packet size, and the license appears to be incompatible with
the GPL.

Gnugol is intended to be a lightweight information sharing
protocol. This is in conflict with it also being a secure protocol.
For now addressing serious privacy concerns is on the back burner.

This isn't to say that there isn't some inherent security built in.

The basic security model will probably consist of trusted networks
and trusted devices:

trusted networks: A network is detected by the combination of
mac address and ip of the default gateway. While this can be spoofed,
if someone already has subverted these two pieces of information, 
you've got bigger problems.

Networks are assigned unique SSID like identifiers, and assigned relative
degrees of trust. To give an example, let's say you have a laptop that 
you use at home, at work, and at a cafe. 

At home, you access material you got from work, and from the cafe.
You share it on your home network, but you might choose not to share
the information from the cafe.

At work, you access material from work, but not from home, or the cafe,
and you share information from work at work, but not from home or the cafe.

At the cafe, you access material from home, and work, but share none of it.

As for trusted devices, this gets trickier. The answer to this problem
is too small to be written in the margin of this missive.
