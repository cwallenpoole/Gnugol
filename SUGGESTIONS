David Rowe suggested a local pastebin client. The problem with pastebins
is you have to be on the internet to have one. Now, you could run a 
pastebin server on your laptop, but with this sort of shared architecture
you could (maybe) do it in the fly...

git-diff | pastebin drowe # would create a pastebin called drowe

vs posting it...

gnugol pastebin: drowe or a search for drowe.pastebin would find it
on the local network or the co-operating servers.

you might be able to do something like git-diff | wget http//somepastebin?post but that means you get an url back that you just need to share somehow

makes sense to have a "network clipboard" to share your work locally
