You will need working IPv6, or a working IPv6 tunnel. I note that I'm not
particularly impressed by a default 6in4 route running on the gateway, it
seems to be much faster in general to get a static tunnel from one of the
many tunnel brokers out there and use that on the gateway or client machine.

A whole lot of gateways don't pass protocol 41, either, though. That's
part of the fun, I guess.

At present you need to install pygoogle. This requires a license key. For now, you can use mine.

You also need the boutell c cgilib library.

do a make
then a sudo make install

To install a version that talks to my server in california.

To install one that talks to localhost, (useful for debugging or when you 
have no outside ipv6 connectivity)

make DEBUG="-DDUMMY_SERVER -DDUMMY_CLIENT"
