Because the clients and servers are evolving rapidly, 
I'd like to expire them and require that people
get new ones every two weeks (for now) rather than 
expend lots of effort to remain backwards compatible.

Look into public key infrastructure and openID

Do a command line client

Path MTU

IPv4 UDP

gnugol over other transports (irc bots, email)

DNS lookaside cache

DB lookaside cache
