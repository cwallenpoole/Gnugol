	<h2>A renegade client could respond to local multicast queries with spam - links and offensive stuff unrelated to the query itself</h2>   

1) this is a violation of the gnugol protocol. I would like to be able to take legal action against those that violate it. 2) One client side option is to rate-limit incoming requests. The other is to report offending clients to a more central authority. A third is to migrate to a new multicast network address. A 4th is to require encryption
on responses.

There are not a lot of good answers to this problem.
