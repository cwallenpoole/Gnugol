<h1> Scenario: OLPC - A teacher and 20 students </h1>
<div name=index>A teacher prepares a lesson plan using internet resources and gnugol. In her (well-connected) home, she does her queries using the gnugol plugin, which downloads and keeps organized her data set, collecting the bits of data that she will use to teach the lesson. She then goes to the school for the lesson. Her students, while recieving the lesson, also do queries, many of which the teacher has already asked, and are cached on her laptop, and thus are presented immediately to the kids without the need for external network access.
