*** DONE make buffer more of an object

** Shell mode
*** UTF-8 
   Gnugol has currently a very limited selection of html escapes to utf-8 support, implemented via a silly lookup routine. It would be better to have it be complete, and hashed with gperf.
   There are many tools out there that try to do this (php and perl have examples), I just haven't got around to doing it myself.
** Line/word breaking support
   Coping with [[UTF-8]] is a difficult problem in C. What needs to happen is a fairly complex routine that does line breaking based on the value of the environment variable "COLUMNS" and the nearest UTF-8 word.
** Non-utf-8 terminals
   Gnugol does not detect when it has a different character set than UTF-8.
(I am not particularly interested in anything other than html<->utf-8 conversion, frankly)
** org mode
*** gnugol.el is incomplete
   In addition to browsing the output from 
** DONE Output needs to be sensitive to the level of the current outline
   --levels 0-5
** Does not properly escape "[" characters when in a url or text snippet.
** Limited search engine support
*** DONE Google's basic engine is essentially complete
*** DONE Dummy engine
*** TODO Google json interface version 2
*** TODO Bing
*** TODO Wikipedia
*** TODO DNS
*** TODO Opensearch
*** TODO RFCs
*** TODO Citeseer
** TODO outputs
*** Custom printf-like string
*** Markdown
    Decide on output formatting
*** CSV
*** XML
    Need a standardized XML definition for gnugol's output. There must be one out there.
*** SQL
    SQL output would be nice
   but has much potential for abuse.
*** JSON
    Be able to dump the raw json output
*** TODO SSML 
    SSML is totally untested at present
**** Need a marking scheme for speech enabled search
** SearchMarks
   Unimplemented, prototyping in emacs
* Gnugold Bugs
** Complete rewrite in progress
** The old UDP based protocol didn't work out
** Misbehaving clients 
** Evil/renegade clients 
A renegade client could respond to local multicast queries with spam - links and offensive stuff unrelated to the query itself. 

This is a violation of the gnugol protocol. I would like to be able to take violent or legal action against those that violate it. 

There are not a lot of good answers to this problem.
*** Rate-limit incoming requests?
*** Report offending clients to a more central authority. 
*** Migrate to a new multicast network address. 
*** Require encryption/authentication on queries and responses.
* Ggl bugs
** Not even started yet!
* WIP
** Decisions
*** Get the command line options under control
**** for output switch to -o {format,format,format} (obsolete --wiki --org --etc)
**** also have printf-like format options for snippets, ads, etc (obsolete -a -s -t)
     [[http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=3874&action=view][Glibc has a standard for extending printf]] but does uclibc?

*** Switch to a build system
    - configure is ancient but we do want to cross compile. Configure takes longer than the actual compile!
*** Enable Internationalization
    - autodetect 
*** Decide on a transport protocol
    - sctp: main target
    - udp:  makes sense for small queries
    - tcp:  While well understood I really don't care
*** Security infrastructure
*** Engine infrastructure
*** Cleanly distribute api across client/transport/server
** IDEAS
*** Interface for blind users
*** Firefox plugin
*** Transclusion
* Roadmap
  Get to plausible promise
** Must: 
*** Implement timeouts
*** sha1 hashes
*** Lookaside cache
*** Compression
*** Lookaside DNS
** Should:
*** Work on OLPC, fedora, ubuntu
*** work on non-x86 architectures (nokia n810, blackfin)
*** multicast on local networks
*** Have a stable server/website to use
*** deb package
** WON'T:
*** be clean code
*** not core dump occasionally
*** have firefox plugin
*** work over ipv4 
*** have windows port
