* Gnugol Bugs
** Shell mode
*** UTF-8 
   Gnugol has currently a very limited selection of html escapes to utf-8 support, implemented via a silly lookup routine. It would be better to have it be complete, and hashed with gperf.
   There are many tools out there that try to do this (php and perl have examples), I just haven't got around to doing it myself.
** Line/word breaking support
   Coping with [[UTF-8]] is a difficult problem in C. What needs to happen is a fairly complex routine that does line breaking based on the value of the environment variable "COLUMNS" and the nearest UTF-8 word.
** Non-utf-8 terminals
   Gnugol does not detect when it has a different character set than UTF-8.
(I am not particularly interested in anything other than html<->utf-8 conversion, frankly)
** org mode
*** gnugol.el is incomplete
   In addition to browsing the output from 
** Output needs to be sensitive to the level of the current outline
   --level 3
** Does not properly escape "[" characters when in a url or text snippet.
** Limited search engine support
*** Google's basic engine is essentially complete
** TODO Bing
** TODO Wikipedia
** TODO DNS
** TODO Opensearch
** TODO RFCs
** TODO Citeseer
** SSML 
*** SSML is totally untested at present
** Need a marking scheme for speech enabled search
** XML
*** Need a standardized XML definition for gnugol's output
** 
** SQL
*** SQL output would be nice
   but has much potential for abuse.
** SearchMarks
*** Unimplemented
* Gnugold Bugs
** Complete rewrite in progress
** The old UDP based protocol didn't work out
** Misbehaving clients 

** Evil/renegade clients 
A renegade client could respond to local multicast queries with spam - links and offensive stuff unrelated to the query itself. 

This is a violation of the gnugol protocol. I would like to be able to take violent or legal action against those that violate it. 

There are not a lot of good answers to this problem.

*** Rate-limit incoming requests?
*** Report offending clients to a more central authority. 
*** Migrate to a new multicast network address. 
*** require encryption/authentication on responses.
